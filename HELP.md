### Docker Compose support

This project contains a Docker Compose file named `compose.yaml`.

However, no services were found. As of now, the application won't start!

Please make sure to add at least one service in the `compose.yaml` file.

### Maven Parent overrides

Due to Maven's design, elements are inherited from the parent POM to the project POM.
While most of the inheritance is fine, it also inherits unwanted elements like `<license>` and `<developers>` from the
parent.
To prevent this, the project POM contains empty overrides for these elements.
If you manually switch to a different parent and actually want the inheritance, you need to remove those overrides.
